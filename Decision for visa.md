# Visa Application Decision Log

## Decision 1 User stories
## Context
Need a description for the user roles to know what each user will be using the system for.
## alternatives
- genric user story per role
- just have user role with small description
- detailed user story per role
## Decision and reason
The reason i have chosen to do the detailed per role is because it will outline everything the user would want to do and give a idea of what the rolem of that user is within the system.

## Decision 2 Use case diagram
## Context
Clear documentation and a visual representation of the use cases are required to give a thorough understanding of the functioning of the system and the ways in which various actors interact with it.
# Alternatives
- use case diagram
- use case discription
- Have both description and diagram
## Decision and reason
It was decided to provide both a description and a diagram since it offers the most comprehensive understanding. Developers, testers, and new team members need depth and context from the thorough explanation to fully understand the specifics of each use case, but the diagram provides an easily accessible visual overview.

## Decision 3 Non/Functional Requiremnts
## Context
In developing the system, there is a need to identify and document the non-functional/functional requirements that are critical to the system's success and overall performance.
# Alternatives
-  list all requiremnts
-  write every requirement
- write about a select amount and give brief detail

## Decision and reason
Since it is the most practical course of action, the third option was selected. Detailed documentation of every criteria would be impracticable and would distract from the most important elements. A specific subset is chosen and detailed in order to keep the documentation clear, impactful, and to guarantee that the most important aspects of system performance and user satisfaction are adequately covered.

## Decision 4 perosna and scenarios
## Context
It is imperative to ensure that the system architecture and functionality are in line with the needs and behaviours of actual users when developing the visa processing system.
# Alternatives
- Generic Personas
- Basic Scenarios Only
- Detailed Personas and Scenarios
## Decision and reason
Because it offers a deeper and more complex insight of the users , the thorough approach was chosen. In-depth personas aid in developing empathy for users and precisely defining their wants, and scenarios guarantee that these demands are met when the system is used in actual situations.

## Decision 5 Prototype
## Context
Before beginning full-scale development, it is necessary to test the system's design and usability using an actual prototype that stakeholders can interact with and offer input on.
# Alternatives
- skip prototype
- interactive prototype
- static prototype
- static prototype on mockplus
## Decision and reason
Mockplus was chosen because of its wide interactive elements, user-friendliness, and collaborative capabilities that facilitate rapid feedback and iterations. It is a great tool for testing and validating design choices made early in the development process because of its capacity to replicate a broad range of interactions and transitions, which closely resembles the intended functionality of the finished product.

## Decision 7 Class diagram
## Context
A visual depiction of these components is necessary to specify the system's structure and provide an understandable model of the data objects and their interactions.
# Alternatives
- ERD
- DOMAIN model
- Class diagram
## Decision and reason
Because it offers a precise and comprehensive picture of the system's architecture—a vital resource for developers and designers alike—the UML Class Diagram was selected. It describes the interactions between various components of the system, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency, facilitating maintainability and scalability, and establishing roles and connections.

## Decision 8 Context Diagram
## Context 
To establish a high-level view of how the visa processing system interacts with external entities and systems, a clear visual representation of these relationships is necessary.
# Alternatives
- System Interface Diagram: 
- Context Diagram
## Decision and reason
The context diagram was selected because it gives stakeholders a quick visual overview of the external interfaces and system boundaries, which is essential for them to understand how the system fits into the bigger picture. It facilitates the identification of any external entities that will communicate with the system and guarantees that these interfaces are properly understood and created.

## Decision 9 Sequence diagram 
## Context
An ordered illustration of these interactions is necessary for a thorough knowledge and planning of the unique interactions that occur over time between system actors and components, especially for complicated transactions in the visa processing system.
# Alternatives
- Sequence Diagram
## Decision and reason
The sequence diagram was chosen for its ability to clearly depict the order of operations and the interaction between system components and actors, providing a step-by-step breakdown of the processes. This level of detail is particularly beneficial for developers and testers to understand the timing and sequence of messages and events, which is crucial for implementing and verifying complex transactional behavior in the system.

## Decision 10 Code 
## Context
In the development phase of the visa processing system, a decision on the programming environment and language for creating an initial code prototype was necessary. This prototype would serve as a conceptual representation of what the final product could look like.
# Alternatives
- React
- C#
- HTML
- PYTHON
- C# Windows form
## Decision and reason
Because of its many libraries and tools that facilitate the creation of complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially for Windows environments, C# Windows Forms was selected. The selection was impacted by C#'s ability to manage the intricacy of a visa processing system's needs, as well as how simple it was to prototype complex interfaces. Despite not being the final version, it offers a strong basis for showcasing the possible features and design of the finished product.
